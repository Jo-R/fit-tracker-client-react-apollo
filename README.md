Another fit tracker client: this time using apollo!

Is a create-react-app so npm i, npm start to get going.

Uses [this apollo server project](https://github.com/Jo-R/fit-tracker-apollo-server) which wraps [this rest api](https://github.com/Jo-R/FitnessTracker) so you'll need both of those running for it to work.
